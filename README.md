# ENG202_final_project
Prompt: Building a line-following robot to follow a line using computer vision and OpenCV.

The robot is powered by a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Raspberry Pi OS to deploy the OpenCV model, and an Arduino Uno to commucate with the Raspberry and control the motors.

The video demonstrates how our robot works is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OnaljuKn4o9rPp2lVWc9CIcVXmSjMVy0?usp=sharing)

The repository contains two files:
1. Betracer.ino: Arduino codes to communicate with Raspberry and control the motors.
2. Betracer.py: Python codes to deploy the OpenCV model and send commands to the Arduino board.
